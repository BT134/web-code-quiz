# Web API Coding Quiz - Week 4 Homework

## Desciption

> I was tasked with creating a timed multiple choice coding quiz app that was to run in the browser. The app must run in any browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I had to write from scratch. It must have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

## My User Storey Was: 
>```md

SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```
